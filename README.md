# Speaker-Diarization-with-Python

What is speaker diarization?
	Speaker diarization is the process of partitioning input audio streams into homogeneous segments according to speaker identity.
	It is a combination of speaker segmentation and speaker clustering.

How does speaker diarization work?
	One strategy for speaker diarization is the use of Guassian mixture models to create the model of each speaker,
	the assign correspondence frames for each speaker using a hidden markov model.
